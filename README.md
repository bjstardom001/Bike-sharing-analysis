🚲 Bike Sharing Analytics Dashboard (Power BI Project)
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bike sharing data to uncover ridership patterns, user behavior, and operational performance.
The goal was to clean, transform, and visualize data in Power BI, generating actionable insights and recommendations.

📊 Dataset
Size: ~5,000 records

After Cleaning: 507 valid trips

Source Fields: Trip times, Bike ID, Stations, Age Group, Temperature, User Type

🛠️ Data Preparation
Verified and corrected data types (date, time, numeric, text).

Removed duplicates using Bike ID → reduced to 507 records.

Fixed spelling inconsistencies.

Ensured data was ready for modeling and visualization.
